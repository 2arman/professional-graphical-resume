            Navaco CORE Banking project ordered by Maskan Bank to implement banks’ functional and non-functional requirements such as accounting,
            deposit, lending, card and etc.\ Its serious implementation started around 2017 and I have been contributing to the project since March 2017
            as a key member of architecture team.\ The team has a crucial role in the project and has some important tasks such as designing architecture model and
            implementing a framework that is used by other developers to reduce implementation time.\ In fact, I have a crucial role in designing architecture model and
            implementing several APIs for batch processing.\ I also design and implement some important banks’ functional requirements such as lending overnight calculation.

            deposit, lending, card and etc.\ Its serious implementation started around 2008.\ I have been contributing to the project since September 2009
            as a key member of Lending team which deals with loans, bank guarantees and collateral.\ In fact, I had a crucial role in designing and implementing
            several functionalities such as installment table calculation, product management, repayment, settlement and modern banking services.\ I, besides,
            have cooperated in infrastructural components related to lending system.\ It is valuable to mention that Lotus project has been operational in

            Lending conversion project, which aimed to migrate all information from Negin CORE Banking Solution into Lotus CORE Banking Solution,
            started actively in March 2011.\ I was designated as the superior and architect in order to design and implement the project.\ Inherently
            critical constraints such as gradual data migration in several phases and live migration without disruption had to be done accurately, which
            made it difficult to implement the project.\ The conversion project composed of multi-threaded Spring Batch and PL-SQl routines.\ The project
            was utilized in three operational phases successfully without any faults.
